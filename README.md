AIM : Hello World and Calculator program

SOFTWARE USED : VS CODE

THEORY : In C++, the #include <iostream> header is used to enable input and output operations, allowing the use of cin for input and cout for output. The main() function serves as the entry point of the program and is mandatory in every C++ application. The cout statement is used to display output on the screen, while cin is used to accept user input from the keyboard. Arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, and / perform basic mathematical operations, and the modulus operator % gives the remainder of a division operation. The results of these operations can either be printed directly or stored in variables for clarity and reuse. All variables in C++ must be declared with a suitable data type before use. Each statement in C++ ends with a semicolon (;), and the return 0; statement at the end of the main() function signifies that the program has executed successfully. C++ is case-sensitive, so identifiers with different cases are treated distinctly. Indentation and comments, though not required for execution, are essential for improving code readability and understanding.


ALGORITHM (for the calc prog) : 

Start

Declare two integer variables a and b

Assign values to a and b (e.g., a = 10, b = 5)

Calculate:

sum = a + b

diff = a - b

mul = a * b

div = a / b

Display the values of sum, diff, mul, and div

Stop
