AIM : Hello World and Calculator program

SOFTWARE USED : VS CODE

THEORY : The #include <iostream> header allows input and output in C++.
The main() function is the entry point of the program.
The cout statement is used to display output like "Hello, World!" on the screen.
Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) perform basic math operations on integers.
Results can be printed directly or stored in variables for clarity and reuse.

ALGORITHM (for the calc prog) : 

Start

Declare two integer variables a and b

Assign values to a and b (e.g., a = 10, b = 5)

Calculate:

sum = a + b

diff = a - b

mul = a * b

div = a / b

Display the values of sum, diff, mul, and div

Stop
