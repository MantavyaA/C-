#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 5;

    int sum = a + b;
    int diff = a - b;
    int mul = a * b;
    int div = a / b;

    cout << "Sum = " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Difference = " << diff << endl;
    cout << "Multiplication = " << mul << endl;
    cout << "Division = " << div << endl;

    return 0;
}


EXPECTED OUTPUT : Sum = 15
                  Difference = 5
                  Multiplication = 50
                  DIVISION = 2
